# MoodRing


## Introduction

MoodRing is an application that is part survey, part journal and part mirror. It allows the user to reflect on their day and then later look back at that information to gain a better understanding of how they are feeling from day to day, as well as which activities or thoughts associate with which moods.

## Documentation
This application allows users to create a private account. Once logged in to their account, they are presented with a survey that asks them to rate their day on a 5 point scale, describe how they feel, what they did, and to include any notable details. The user can do this as many times as they would like. Once submitted, the user can then see their posts in the archive. Once they have a few posts, the user can look back at how they've felt on average and what activities or thoughts they associated with that day.
